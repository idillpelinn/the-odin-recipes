    <p>Joey refuses to go on a second date with Phoebe's friend Sarah.
        On their first date, she committed the unforgiveable sin of ordering a sidesalad
        and then reaching over to Joey's plate and eat some of his fries.
        It is not about a few fries, it is about what the fries represent --more food!
        Joey does not share food! and who can blame the guy? Food is just too delicious! Her's a repice for fries that can be shared...Possibly?

           <li>If making by hand cut the potatoes then place them in separate containers filled with water.
            If using frozen or store bought potatoes cook potatoes according to the directions then skip to step 4.
       </li>
       <li>20 minutes before frying pat potatoes fry and toss sweet potatoes in Cornstrach or potato strach until well coated
        then place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

       <li>In a large heavy bottomed pot heat oil to 375°F.
        Working in batches and using a slotted spoon place potatoes in fryer and fry until they rise to the top about 5 minutes. 
        Proceed in batches until all fries anf fries
       </li>
       <li>Spread potatoes evenly over the parchment lined baking sheet making sure they are not overlapping.
        Once all the fries are fried place the baking sheet in the 
        freezer for 30 minutes and allow the potatoes to blanch</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 120°F</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are blanched and working in batches fry potatoes again 
            until potatoes are cpips---crunchy on the outside and tender in the 
            middle---about 7-10 minutes. 
            Place french fires on a lined paper twel platter and keep warm in the oven.
            Salt and pepper the potatoes to taste.
        </li>
        <li>When ready to serve using a large bowl toss potatoes in garlic, parmesan and parsley mixture
            and stack on a large wooden cutting board. Toss the curly fries in tajine and stack in a large pile 
            on the board. Stack in the same way for the sweet potato fries. 
            Place the sacues in small bowls or ramekines and stagger on the board</li>
